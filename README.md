# This is a piece of the site rozetka.com.ua. Written using React.js, Redux, TypeScript

1. First of all, you can configure how many cards will appear and almost every card parameter in the cardsData.ts file. All parameters are automatically generated within a predetermined range, which is easy to reconfigure

2. I use 3 reducers, the first for product cards, the second for storing fields by which the cards can be sorted, and the third - filterReducer for storing enabled filter

3. The project also contains small examples of working with svg graphics (for example, filling a rating with a color based on a digital parameter)

4. Computer models are not connected with the pictures or the operating system they are generated randomly
